# challengeEcommerceVanillaJS

# I had to implement a reouter in vanillaJS in order to navigate the id-marcamodelo url. This is a SPA done in vanilla JS with routing

# On the detail page, it fetches the api every 5 seconds

# the stock and price get refreshed reading and fetching the /api/stockprice/code. Internally I have created mock files inside this folder
